This code is modified based on the "mirrorMesh" utility of OpenFOAM.
Instead of combining source mesh and mirrored mesh, only the mirrored part is generated with this code.

The command and usage are same as the "mirrorMesh" utility.
For further information, you can go this website, https://www.openfoam.com/documentation/guides/latest/man/mirrorMesh.html

I am looking forward to any suggestions and comments.
